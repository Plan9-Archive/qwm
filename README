quite usable, but needs some improvement.


# intro

qwm is a window manager for inferno, an alternative to inferno's wm/wm.
its arrangement of stacks of windows in columns is similar to acme.

the major difference is that qwm always has 9 columns (1-9, similar to
dwm), and that visibility of a column can be toggled.  this makes
columns similar to "work spaces" in other window managers.  by default
only column 1 is visible.

columns can be moved and resized by clicking or dragging the box in
the upper left corner.  windows can be moved and resized by dragging
the titlebar and clicking its buttons.  windows and columns can also
be manipulated by keyboard commands.  these commands are single
characters preceded by a ^q, control-q.  key commands exist for
creating a new window, moving a window between columns, resizing
windows, and resizing columns and making columns visible or hidden.

see the manual page for details.


# install

make sure $ROOT is set.  now "mk install" to compile and install the
files.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.

if you want to use button2 and button3 clicks on title bars of
windows, apply the patch titlebar.b.diff to /appl/lib/titlebar.b, and
compile and install that module.  this module is used by applications
to draw the title bar bind mouse events to it.

it's also advisable to "bind -b /icons/tinytk /icons/tk", to make the
title bars a bit less big.

# todo

- don't hang on programs that have been killed (or are not responding?).  it seems we kill the procs behind nbwm, but don't drop the reference to win.
- see if it's fixable that charon crashes when it gets a small image (with negative dy)

- make "col bigger" smarter.  where it takes the space from is weird.
- make heuristics for which window gets screen size after one closes different.
- perhaps make [jk] give the new window the same amount of height as a 'i'?
- better window placement
- perhaps place window in adjacent column when that has lots of space

- change how Screens deal with fill:  use SoverD instead of S when drawing, so we can use Nofill and get a no-op, instead of a black screen
- make it possible to run in existing draw context
- floating mode?
- allow user to edit text in tag, with b2 for execute?  remove -t tag cmd
