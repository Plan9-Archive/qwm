quite usable, but needs some improvement.


# intro

qwm is a window manager for inferno, an alternative to inferno's wm/wm.
its arrangement of stacks of windows in columns is similar to acme.

the major difference is that qwm always has 9 columns (1-9, similar to
dwm), and that visibility of a column can be toggled.  this makes
columns similar to "work spaces" in other window managers.  by default
only column 1 is visible.

columns can be moved and resized by clicking or dragging the box in
the upper left corner.  windows can be moved and resized by dragging
the titlebar and clicking its buttons.  windows and columns can also
be manipulated by keyboard commands.  these commands are single
characters preceded by a ^q, control-q.  key commands exist for
creating a new window, moving a window between columns, resizing
windows, and resizing columns and making columns visible or hidden.

see the manual page for details.


# install

make sure $ROOT is set.  now "mk install" to compile and install the
files.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.

if you want to use button2 and button3 clicks on title bars of
windows, apply the patch titlebar.b.diff to /appl/lib/titlebar.b, and
compile and install that module.  this module is used by applications
to draw the title bar bind mouse events to it.

it's also advisable to "bind -b /icons/tinytk /icons/tk", to make the
title bars a bit less big.

# todo

- when moving windows between columns, the title bar can easily become very small, we'll have to move windows around to keep at least Winmin height for the moved window.
- bug: menu's from wm/sh always show in upper-left corner, full width.
- bug: unhiding a window while in single mode shows the windows as if it was in stack mode.  it should show the unhidden window in place of the current window.

- when moving columns off-screen, don't resize their windows, only change their origin?
- for Msingle, use window ordering to show the right window?  requires Refbackup i think
- handle "delete" fioctl.write's?  what to do with them?
- find out when we get wctlc recvs?  and handle them.  it seems nothing uses wmcontext.wctl.
- multiple windows/tags for a "client"?  eg for popup.  how do clients make new images?  why don't they close the windows themselves?

- make "col bigger" smarter.  where it takes the space from is weird.
- make heuristics for which window gets screen size after one closes different.
- perhaps make [jk] give the new window the same amount of height as a 'i'?
- better window placement

- make it possible to run in existing draw context.  cannot do mousewarping...
- floating mode?
- allow user to edit text in tag, with b2 for execute?  remove -t tag cmd
